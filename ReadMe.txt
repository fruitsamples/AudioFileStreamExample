### AudioFileStreamExample ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

The AudioFileStreamExample project provides two targets, a client that receives the streamed data and parses it for the appropriate audio file properties and data, and a server that opens an AudioFile for read and sends the raw bytes over a specified port. The example shows how to utilize the AudioFileStream callback mechanisms to received and process the data provided by the server, and plays the audio data using the AudioQueue API.
